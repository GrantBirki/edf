## Getting There üöó

The best way to get to EDF at [Moon Hill Dairy](https://goo.gl/maps/vFQcLSZLkSNV3dhG8) is by car. We actually did have people bike to EDF last year but we really do not suggest this. You should try and coordinate with other people to carpool if you can. There will be plenty of parking either way.

## Food and Drink üçª

There will be plenty of food at the festival. We reccomend you bring some of your own snacks.

### Stuff you can bring

Here is a quick list of supplies that you may want to bring to EDF to help us out:

- Paper plates
- Solo cups
- Chips
- Breakfast items for campers
- Water
- Soda
- Beer
- Liquor
- Wine
- Ice (if you have a cooler)

We will have trash cans and bags setup around EDF. Last year we also grilled up burgers and brats for everyone and we will _most likely_ do the same this year.

## Camping ‚õ∫

We highly recommend camping as the music goes quite late and most people end up drinking to some extent. There is plenty of space to camp and nearly everyone else there will be camping as well. If you do not want to camp, you can always drive back into town but please do not drink and drive.

You can bring a tent, RV, or just sleep in your car. This isn't really "forest" camping and its more like "field" camping next to the dairy.

If you bring a tent, make sure to get it setup before dark!

## Supplies üì¶

Here are some supplies you might want to bring to EDF:

- Flashlight
- Bug spray
- Blankets
- Warm clothes
- Pillows
- Sleeping bag
- LiquidIV or Pedialyte!!!
- Earplugs

Please keep in mind that EDF is roughly 30 minutes outside of Steamboat Springs by car. If you forget something, you can always drive into town to get it but you'll be on the road for at least an hour round trip.

## Safety ‚ù§Ô∏è

Do **NOT** bring your dog. There is loud music and fireworks. Your dog will not have a good time and will probably run away. Please leave your dog at home.

If you choose to become intoxicated (in any form), we will be checking your car keys and ask that you camp overnight. At a certain point in the night the car parking area will also close to prevent intoxicated drivers from leaving. Most people choose to drink and camp overnight so this is not a big deal. If you have somewhere to be or cannot camp, please do not drink. The road back to town is dark and windy at night and we don't want anyone driving back to town intoxicated and getting into an accident on 4th of July weekend.

It should also be noted that this is a dairy that is in full operation. There are cows, chickens, dogs, and turkeys. Please do not do anything to the animals or the property that would cause harm. There are also fences, barbed wire, and random bits of metal about. Please be careful, watch where you are walking, and bring good shoes.
