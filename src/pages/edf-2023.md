## Getting There üöó

The best way to get to EDF at [Moon Hill Dairy](https://goo.gl/maps/vFQcLSZLkSNV3dhG8) is by car. We actually did have people bike to EDF last year but we really do not suggest this. You should try and coordinate with other people to carpool if you can. There will be plenty of parking either way.

## Food and Drink üçª

There will be plenty of food at the festival. We reccomend you bring some of your own snacks, cheese can be purchased onsite from [Moon Hill Dairy](www.moonhilldairy.com) to support the venue.

### Stuff you can bring:

- Paper plates
- Solo cups
- Chips
- Breakfast items for campers
- Water
- Soda
- Beer
- Liquor
- Wine
- Ice (if you have a cooler)

We will have trash cans and bags setup around EDF. Last year we also grilled up burgers and brats for everyone and we will _most likely_ do the same this year.

## Camping ‚õ∫

We highly recommend camping it is a beatiful area and we do not want drunk drivers leaving the property. There is going to be a designated camping areas, setup your tent before dark!

## Supplies üì¶

Here are some supplies you might want to bring to EDF:

- Flashlight
- Bug spray
- Blankets
- Warm clothes
- Pillows
- Sleeping bag
- LiquidIV or Pedialyte!!!

Please keep in mind that EDF is roughly 30 minutes outside of Steamboat Springs by car. If you forget something, you can always drive into town to get it but you'll be on the road for at least an hour round trip.

## Safety ‚ù§Ô∏è

- EDF is not a safe place for everyone and we do not want everyone to have a safe environment as well.
- If you choose to become intoxicated (in any form), we will be checking your car keys and ask that you camp overnight.
- At a certain point in the night the car parking area will close to prevent intoxicated drivers from leaving.
- This is the case for most people so it isn't a big deal.
- The road back to town is dark and windy at night and we don't want anyone driving back to town intoxicated and getting into an accident on 4th of July weekend.
- It should also be noted that this is a dairy that is in full operation.
- There are cows, chickens, dogs, and turkeys. Please do not do anything to the animals or the property that would cause harm.
- There are also fences, barbed wire, and random bits of metal about.
- Please be careful, watch where you are walking, and bring good shoes.
