## EDF 2023 ðŸŽ§

Memories from the EDF 2023 event - July 3nd, 2023

## Event ðŸ¥³

For EDF 2023, we wanted the event to be even larger than our debut year in 2022. Last year we had five live DJs and for 2023 we brought that up to 10 (might have been a little too much). Daniel brought out about 5x the amount of lights that we had last year and an expanded light board as well. We had the usual firework setup and even some lasers this year as well.

The party included plenty of the following:

- Campers
- Smoked brisket
- Beer and drinks galore
- Friends, friends, friends, friends
- Cornhole
- Volleyball
- Music + partying
- Cows

So many people were camping all over the propery in tents, cars, RVs, and campers that it was actually difficult to get a total headcount on how many people attended. If we had to guess, it would be between 80-120 people throughout the night.

The original sub that we had rented was actually so powerful, we couldn't even hook it up to the test setup our provider had. It would just immediately blow either a fuse, trip a surge protector, or kick the amp off. So instead, we opted to go with another set of subs which our provider had rented to Red Rocks for a show the night before. We embarked on a journey to collect the subs from deep inside Red Rocks for our own event.

Myself, Garrett, and Ian collected the mighty subs.

*Dead Rocks* (Zeds Dead) was playing that night, but all the people there didn't realize the *real* party was at EDF.

### Night ðŸŽ†

When the sun started to go down, things really started to kick into gear. We had fireworks, sparklers, leds, a smoke machine, a full light board, and even lasers. During this part of the night, we started to lack camera operators and a whole lot of people started showing up.
