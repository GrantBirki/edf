##### Power Consumption 🔌

It might be overkill but we should probably do some math and create a max power draw total for all our equipment

##### Connection Diagram 📊

It might be overkill but we should probably create a diagram of all the connections on the equipment we are renting for the following reasons:

- So we can be familiar for connecting the devices
- So we can determine if we need any extra cables
- So we can discover any potential issues before we find them during setup at the Dairy

#### Pickup / Drop off 🚗

We will be renting all our main sound equipment from [Colorado Mobile Music](https://coloradomobilemusic.com/)

Here are some general details about picking up and dropping off the equipment:

- I (@grantbirki) will be in Denver, CO on July 2nd to pick up the equipment with Ian
- We will go straight from Denver, CO to the Dairy to setup for EDF
- We plan on camping at the Dairy the night of EDF. The following day is July 3rd and someone will need to return the equipment to Colorado Mobile Music so we do not get charged for a second day of rentals
